# Pearfection Timer

A simple web app for time task management. 

It features three types of timers: 
1. `Task Time`, which tracks the total time spent on a task
2. `Focus Time`, which tracks continuous, uninterrupted, work sessions
3. `Break Time`, which tracks how much time you still need to be on break. 

## Key features:

+ **Dual Timer:** Tracks total time and ongoing focus time (or remaining break time) simultaneously. 
+ **Audiovisual cues:** The pear icon changes color and plays a sound when time thresholds are reached. 
+ **Automation:** The application stops and automatically records an entry when the last time threshold is reached. 
+ **Break Timer:** Mininum break time is implemented, the length being determined by which time threshold was reached during a focus session. 
+ **Entry Recording:** Users can record an entry, which includes the total task time, a reference, and the maximum focus time achieved in a session (each entry has an unique identifier). 
+ **Reporting:** All recorded entries are displayed in a table that can be copied. 
+ **Theme:** The application supports light and dark themes.
